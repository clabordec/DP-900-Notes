- On-premises
  - You are the one that manages everything from storage to the data center to networking or virtualiztion and application, basically everything.
  
<br>
  
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - The most flexible category of cloud services
  - You are provided the bare infrastructure that you need to create your own computing
  - Instead of buying hardware, you rent the hardware
  - E.g. virtual machines, hard drive storage space, networking and IP addresses
  - So you can build an environment similar to what you have build on your own data center or hosting provider
  - Aims to give you complete control on the hardware
  - It's like leasing a car, you have complete control of the car, but you do not own that car

  - Platform of a Service (PaaS)
    - Provides a framework for developers that it can build upon and used to create or test or deploy customized applications
    - The goal is to help create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure
    - All server storage networking is managed by the cloud provider, while the developer maintains the management of the application
    - Do not worry about patching or upgrade, that will get taken care of by the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc)
    - It's like taking a Uber or taxi, you don't have to worry about the registration of the car or the proper gas for the car, you just need to focus on were you want to go by giving the proper navigation to the driver

  - Software as a Service
    - Enjoy the service, pay the fees, but you don't manage anything at all
    - Everything is managed by the vendor
    - SaaS is a software that is essentially hosted and managed for the end customer
    - It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers
    - Applications are ran directly through the web browsers and do not require any downloads or installation
    - E.g. Gmail
