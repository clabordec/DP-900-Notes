# Introduction to NoSQL

## RDBMS were lacking

- Scalability
- Flexibility

<br>

## What is NoSQL

"Not Only SQL" or no structure query language

- Scalability: Horizontal scaling is possible
- Flexibility: No schema enforced

<br>

### Vertical Scaling

- Add more CPU, RAM, HDD in the same system

### Horizontal Scaling

- Add more commodity machines in a system

<br>

## NoSQL Use Cases

- Big data and real-time web applications
- Relationship between data is not important
- Data change frequently

<br>

## NoSQL Limitations

- Schema-less data means inconsistent data
- Denormalized data means redundant data
- Redundant data means inaccuracies and conflicts
- Dose not support many good features of Relational DB
  - Examples: Stored procedures, views, row level security, locks, etc.
